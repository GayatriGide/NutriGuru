# NutriGuru Diet Recommender

## Overview
This Python-based diet recommender is designed to provide personalized dietary recommendations based on individual factors such as age, weight, height, gender, and activity level. Leveraging these inputs, the system calculates daily calorie intake requirements and suggests suitable food items to help users achieve their health and fitness goals.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored dietary suggestions considering individual characteristics and activity levels.
- **Calorie Intake Estimation**: Accurate calculation of daily calorie requirements based on user-provided information.
- **Food Item Suggestions**: Recommends a variety of food items suitable for the user's dietary needs and preferences.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for smooth user interaction and experience.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust parameters to explore different dietary options and plans.
- **Data-driven Approach**: Utilizes scientifically-backed formulas and nutrition data to generate recommendations.

## How It Works
1. **Input Data**: Users provide their age, weight, height, gender, and activity level.
2. **Calculation**: The system processes the input data to estimate the user's daily calorie intake requirements.
3. **Recommendations**: Based on calculated values, the system suggests suitable food items along with portion sizes and meal plans.
4. **Feedback and Updates**: Users can provide feedback to improve the recommendation algorithm, ensuring continuous refinement and optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language used for algorithm implementation and backend logic.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for efficient handling of user input and nutritional data.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework used for building the user interface and interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend design elements for enhancing the user experience.
- **Nutrition APIs**: Integration with nutrition databases or APIs for accessing comprehensive food item details.
